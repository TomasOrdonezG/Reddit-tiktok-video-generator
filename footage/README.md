The program pulls footage from here so DELETE THIS README FILE BEFORE RUNNING, otherwise it will think its a video

before running, add an mp4 file of subway surfer's gameplay here (GitHub didn't let me add one because it was too big so you will have to add it on your own)
name the file starting with 'ss', make it mp4, audio doesn't matter, the video should be at least 1:30 because the program speeds it up by 1.5x, this way you will get a video that is at least one min long
