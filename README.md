Before anything, go read the README.md files in each of the folders 'audio', 'footage' and 'videos', they're not a long read but they are important

To run this program:

get access to the reddit API by adding your credentials, it is very easy but reddit apps might be down due to recent events: [how to get credentials for the reddit API](https://www.jcchouinard.com/reddit-api/)
replace the 'XXX' with your credentials on line 179 and 182 inside the create_data function in main.py

INSIDE main.js
- Modify subreddit_names on line 240 to change the subreddits you want to pull data from
- modify number_of_posts_per_subreddit to change the amount of posts from each subreddit
- Run main.js and you generated videos should appear in videos' subfolder's with today's date

sorry for the program not being very user friendly but I never planned on sharing this project and so I never made an interface
